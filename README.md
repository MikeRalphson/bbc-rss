BBC programmes API to RSS adaptor app

The story so far: in October 2014, the BBC [shut down](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/11/03/beeb_clamps_down_on_naughty_iplayer_watching/) their iPlayer RSS feeds. This has made a lot of people very angry, and been widely regarded as a *bad move*.

This app provides over 300 by-category RSS feeds for both iPlayer-radio and the (TV) iPlayer, 
covering available and upcoming programmes. Individual feeds are available for over 40,000 
brands and series. Custom search-driven feeds are also available.

It even suports users with digital watches.
